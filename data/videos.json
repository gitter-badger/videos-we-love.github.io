      "description":"Join Mark on a quick-fire, whistle-stop, shallow-to-the-point-of-vacuous tour through the history of programming and programming languages, from the surprise twist at the beginning, through the Golden Age of LISP, C and Smalltalk, right up to the present day. What was the Greatest Programming Language ever? Which is better: dynamic or static typing? Why is Java? What does the future of programming hold for the brave adventurer? Discover the answers to none of these questions or indeed any others in this utterly pointless but hopefully entertaining talk. Warning: not suitable for children or IT managers.",
